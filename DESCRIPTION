Description: This package Calculates distance between single-arm observational studies by using co-variates information to remove heterogeneity in Network Meta-Analysis in Randomized clinical trials.  This package will facilitate the inclusion of observational data in Network Meta ANalysis, thereby enhancing the comprehensiveness and robustness of comparative effectiveness research.The proposed R package will provide researchers with a powerful tool to systematically adjust for heterogeneity in single-arm observational studies, enabling their integration into NMAs. This will improve the accuracy and reliability of comparative effectiveness research, ultimately informing better healthcare decisions. Schmitz S et. al.
